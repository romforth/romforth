This "C port" implementation is incomplete for now.

The most important part it is missing is the ability to manipulate the return
stack at runtime. See the very first JOURNAL entry for 11 Nov 2022 which goes
into some detail about the difficulties of implementing that feature.

There are some other features that the "C port" is missing as well:
	# "while true" loops : loop{ ... }while{ ... }loop
	# "until true" loops : loop{ ... }until{ ... }loop
	# "for" loops : for{ ... }for
	# the index "i" operator used within "for" loops
	# conditional operators : >= <= > < 0= ~
	# misc stack operators: over third fourth 2dup rot
	# memory allocation : alloc

All of these could, theoretically, be added in without too much effort,
but the return stack is the true stumbling block so it might be a better
use of my time to work on the the other "real" ports instead.
