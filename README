At a superficial level, romforth is just a collection of ports of Forth. It is
a portable, small, baremetal version of Forth that can run from Flash/ROM and
has been ported to a number of CPUs.

Dig deeper though, and you might see that romforth can also be considered a
"porting toolkit" which enables a "stepwise porting framework" that allows you
to port Forth "relatively easily" to any of your favorite CPU architectures.

The various ports that have been done already can be then be considered as
proof of concept of this approach to porting Forth.

At this point you might reasonably ask: Why use Forth for microcontrollers?
I'll go ahead and claim that Forth is a perfect fit for small, resource
constrained systems. Perhaps elsewhere too, but opinions widely differ on that.
Here's some sample code that might be used to blink an LED every second:

	loop{
		green led_on
		500 millisec sleep
		green led_off
		500 millisec sleep
	}loop

romforth is yet another Forth-like implementation meant to (eventually)
run on most "low end" (ie ROM and RAM constrained) microcontrollers.

See PORTING for a list of architectures to which romforth has been ported
as well as all the steps that are required for porting to a new architecture.

Unlike many Forth implementations which require a large number of "words" to
be implemented before you can do anything with it, romforth is meant to be a
"shrink to fit" implementation where the user decides how much of the Forth
functionality they really need and only implement what they really require.

There are four "levels" of Forth that could be implemented in this way.
For lack of better names, I'll refer to these "levels" as:
1/4 : "oneforth" (pun intended), which has only primitives and a data stack
      ROM : ~256 bytes, RAM : in the single digit byte range?
2/4 : "twoforth" which has definitions and a return stack (in addition to
      the primitives and data stack that "oneforth" has)
      ROM : ~256 bytes, RAM : 16 bytes (or thereabouts in two digit byte range)
3/4 : "threeforth" which has a static dictionary (in addition to the primitives
      and definitions and the two stacks that "twoforth" has)
      ROM : ~512 bytes, RAM : 16 bytes (or thereabouts in two digit byte range)
4/4 : a full fledged "fourforth"/full/regular Forth with a dynamic dictionary
      in addition to the rest of the bells and whistles from "threeforth".
      ROM : ~1024 bytes, RAM : 512 bytes or more - to hold the dictionary

These levels are further broken down into a total of ~73 individual steps which
implement incremental pieces of Forth functionality. Each of these steps comes
with tests that can be run to verify each additional piece of functionality as
it is added, one at a time, which helps in having a working implementation at
each and every step along the way.

By design, the most compact implementation is limited to use just a little over
~256 bytes of native code with the rest of the functionality implemented in
machine independent code. Currently, ~100 bytes of machine independent Forth
related functionality is used in the x86 implementation. So the overall
Flash/ROM requirement on x86 is currently about ~350 bytes.

As mentioned earlier, there is also a regression test suite which is called at
boot as part of init (which can be optionally #ifdef'ed out) and that currently
takes an additional ~500 bytes of machine independent code.

romforth is meant to be extended using new "purpose built" Forth words which
can be defined in terms of existing Forth words. The new definitions can be
added in the machine independent "defs.4th".

The new words that have been defined can then be called directly as part of
the CPU boot code/initialization by adding them to "rom.4th".

Running "make" will generate a "forth" binary which can be flashed into ROM
(although in all of the implementations that have been completed so far, the
testing is done using emulation, not actual hardware). I hope to run this on
actual hardware real soon now.

The following (mostly) traditional Forth runtime words are available:
Data Stack operators	: dup drop nip dip swap over rot 2drop third fourth
Data Stack get/set ops	: pick stick
Arithmetic		: + - inc(1+) dec(1-) neg
Memory access		: ! @ c! c@
Comparison operators	: > < >= <= 0= ~
I/O			: key emit p@ p!
Memory allocation	: here alloc
Return stack operators	: >r r>
Call/return		: enter exit call exec
Loop index		: i
Literals		: lit
Bit operators		: & | ^ << >> inv
Control flow		: j(branch) jz(branch0) jnz(branchnz)
Stack switch operators	: sp@! rp@!
Halt			: bye
Conditionals		: if{ ... }else{ ... }if
unconditional loop	: loop{ ... }loop
while loop		: loop{ ... }while{ ... }loop
until loop		: loop{ ... }until{ ... }loop
for loop		: for{ ... }for

At the "oneforth" and "twoforth" levels of the implementation, compared to
regular Forth, what is not available is the dictionary. We make up for that by
providing an "umbilical host"ed solution using a set of scripts, which runs on
the host, and will turn the Forth code into byte code which can be run on top
of the ~350 byte "runtime". This "umbilical host" provides control flow
structures such as conditionals and loop structures which are identical to
the ones available at runtime in the dictionary at the "threeforth"/"fourforth"
levels of the implementation.

So, using about ~350 bytes of "runtime", we can write architecture independent
loops (while, until, for), conditionals (if, else), allocate memory, and even
run threads or invoke semi/full-coroutines (if your proclivities tend that way)

It is reasonable to ask what distinguishes this Forth implementation from
the zillion other implementations that already exist. I think the main
distinguishing features are that it is portable, small and runs baremetal:
1. Portable : romforth currently runs on 16/32/64 bits architectures as well
	as little and big endian CPUs. It was designed with portability in mind
	so as to eventually be able to run on "most" microcontrollers. The
	primitives implemented in native code are only a few instructions
	each. For a compact implementation, only ~256 bytes of native code
	will need to be ported to a new architecture.
2. Small : Designed for low end microcontrollers
	On x86, a minimal init needs ~350 bytes of code and 7 bytes of RAM
	As a proof of concept, for even smaller systems, I've coded up an
	x86 bootloader which needs just a dozen bytes of x86 native code
	to load the additional bytes in via any available serial interface
	- either from an "umbilical host" during testing or from, say, an
	external SPI flash part.
3. Baremetal : Can run directly on the hardware, doesn't require any other
	underlying runtime or OS support.
