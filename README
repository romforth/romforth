romforth is a small, portable, baremetal version of Forth which has been ported
to various 8/16/32/64-bit microcontrollers with support for both big and little
endian architectures. So far, it has been ported to the following instruction
sets: x86 (16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit), PDP11, 68000, SPARC, Z80, MSP430, ARM64,
RISC-V(rv32, rv64), WASM, Padauk, 6502, 8051, 6809, IBM 1130.

So, at a superficial level, romforth is just yet another Forth which has been
ported to a wide variety of CPUs and is meant to be runnable directly from the
Flash/ROM of the microcontroller.

Dig deeper though, and you might see that romforth can also be considered a
"porting toolkit" which enables a "stepwise porting framework" that allows you
to port Forth "relatively easily" to any of your favorite CPU architectures.

The various ports that have been done already can be then be considered as
proof of concept of this approach to porting Forth.

At this point you might reasonably ask: Why use Forth for microcontrollers?
I'll go ahead and claim that Forth is a perfect fit for small, resource
constrained systems. Perhaps elsewhere too, but opinions widely differ on that.
Here's some sample code that might be used to blink an LED every second:

	loop{
		green led_on
		500 millisec sleep
		green led_off
		500 millisec sleep
	}loop

romforth is yet another Forth-like implementation meant to (eventually)
run on most "low end" (ie ROM and RAM constrained) microcontrollers.

See PORTING for a list of architectures to which romforth has been ported
as well as all the steps that are required for porting to a new architecture.

Unlike many Forth implementations which require a large number of "words" to
be implemented before you can do anything with it, romforth is meant to be a
"shrink to fit" implementation where the user decides how much of the Forth
functionality they really need and only implement what they really require.

There are four "levels" of Forth that could be implemented in this way.
For lack of better names, I'll refer to these "levels" as:
1/4 : "oneforth" (pun intended), which has only primitives and a data stack
      ROM : ~256 bytes, RAM : in the single digit byte range?
2/4 : "twoforth" which has definitions and a return stack (in addition to
      the primitives and data stack that "oneforth" has)
      ROM : ~256 bytes, RAM : 16 bytes (or thereabouts in two digit byte range)
3/4 : "threeforth" which has a static dictionary (in addition to the primitives
      and definitions and the two stacks that "twoforth" has)
      ROM : ~512 bytes, RAM : 16 bytes (or thereabouts in two digit byte range)
4/4 : a full fledged "fourforth"/full/regular Forth with a dynamic dictionary
      in addition to the rest of the bells and whistles from "threeforth".
      ROM : ~1024 bytes, RAM : 512 bytes or more - to hold the dictionary

These levels are further broken down into a total of ~74 individual steps which
implement incremental pieces of Forth functionality. Each of these steps comes
with tests that can be run to verify each additional piece of functionality as
it is added, one at a time, which helps in having a working implementation at
each and every step along the way.

By design, the most compact implementation is limited to use just a little over
~256 bytes of native code with the rest of the functionality implemented in
machine independent code. Currently, ~100 bytes of machine independent Forth
related functionality is used in the x86 implementation. So the overall
Flash/ROM requirement on x86 is currently about ~350 bytes. As a proof of
concept, an even more minimal bootstrap mechanism that uses just a dozen bytes
of x86 native code which can load in the rest via any available serial interface
(just like Frank Sergeant's "3 Instruction Forth") is also available.

As mentioned earlier, there is also a regression test suite which is called at
boot as part of init (which can be optionally #ifdef'ed out) and that currently
takes an additional ~500 bytes of machine independent code.

romforth is meant to be extended using new "purpose built" Forth words which
can be defined in terms of existing Forth words. The new definitions can be
added in the machine independent "defs.4th".

The new words that have been defined can then be called directly as part of
the CPU boot code/initialization by adding them to "rom.4th".

Running "make" will generate a "forth" binary which can be flashed into ROM
(although in all of the implementations that have been completed so far, the
testing is done using emulation, not actual hardware). I hope to run this on
actual hardware real soon now.

The following (mostly) traditional Forth runtime words are available:
Data Stack operators	: dup drop nip dip swap over rot 2drop third fourth
Data Stack get/set ops	: pick stick
Arithmetic		: + - inc(1+) dec(1-) neg
Memory access		: ! @ c! c@
Comparison operators	: > < >= <= 0= ~
I/O			: key emit p@ p!
Memory allocation	: here alloc
Return stack operators	: >r r>
Call/return		: enter exit call exec
Loop index		: i
Literals		: lit
Bit operators		: & | ^ << >> inv
Control flow		: j(branch) jz(branch0) jnz(branchnz)
Stack switch operators	: sp@! rp@!
Halt			: bye
Conditionals		: if{ ... }else{ ... }if
unconditional loop	: loop{ ... }loop
while loop		: loop{ ... }while{ ... }loop
until loop		: loop{ ... }until{ ... }loop
for loop		: for{ ... }for

At the "oneforth" and "twoforth" levels of the implementation, compared to
regular Forth, what is not available is the dictionary. We make up for that by
providing an "umbilical host"ed solution using a set of scripts, which runs on
the host, and will turn the Forth code into byte code which can be run on top
of the ~350 byte "runtime". This "umbilical host" provides control flow
structures such as conditionals and loop structures which are identical to
the ones available at runtime in the dictionary at the "threeforth"/"fourforth"
levels of the implementation.

So, using about ~350 bytes of "runtime", we can write architecture independent
loops (while, until, for), conditionals (if, else), allocate memory, and even
run threads or invoke semi/full-coroutines (if your proclivities tend that way)

It is reasonable to ask what distinguishes this Forth implementation from
the zillion other implementations that already exist. I think the main
distinguishing features are that it is portable, small and runs baremetal:
1. Portable : romforth currently runs on 8/16/32/64 bit architectures as well
	as little and big endian CPUs. It was designed with portability in mind
	so as to eventually be able to run on "most" microcontrollers. The
	primitives that need to be implemented in native code are just a few
	instructions each and there are machine independent tests (in Forth) that
	verify the functionality of each primitive as it is added. See the table at
	the end of this README for a list of ports that already exist.
2. Small : Designed for low end microcontrollers romforth is meant to be a
	"shrink to fit" implementation of Forth where the user decides how much of
	the Forth functionality they really need and only implement what they must.
	See the table at the end of this README to see the actual implementation
	sizes for various CPU architectures
3. Baremetal : Can run directly on the hardware, doesn't require any other
	underlying runtime or OS support. In most of the implementations done so
	far, serial I/O needs to be supported if a REPL is required, otherwise an
	"umbilical hosted" support may be needed to flash the code. All of the
	existing ports have been tested using emulation (and/or on x86 Linux).

Installation
============
To make a local copy:
	git clone https://github.com/romforth/romforth

To build/test, the following dependencies need to be installed:
(Note 0: many of the toolchain dependencies required to build this repo are
    available in https://github.com/romforth/toolchain - clone and build that
    first by running `make` in the `toolchain` subdirectory and that will
    populate many of the binaries required for the `romforth` build toolchain.
    Many of the tools that are usually available as distro packages such as the
    C compiler, M4, Make, Perl, Zig and QEMU are currently not built as part of
    the `toolchain` - these need to be installed separately.)
(Note 1: the version number in parentheses is the "known to work" version used
	in testing, older/newer versions may or may not work)
(Note 2: If you are only doing a partial build for a specific processor by
	running `make` within a subdirectory, a subset of these dependencies is
	sufficient. For example, for the x86 port, a C compiler and the `nasm`
	x86 assembler might be more than sufficient.)

	- make (GNU Make 4.1)
	- perl (v5.22.1)
	- nasm (version 2.15.05 compiled on Aug 28 2020)
	- gcc (version 5.3.1 20160413 (Ubuntu 5.3.1-14ubuntu2))
	- binutils ((GNU Binutils) 2.38)

	- simh (open-simh V4.0-0 Current git commit id: 33aad325)
	- zig (0.11.0)
	- qemu (7.1.0, via nix)
	- sdcc (4.2.0 #13081 (Linux))
	- ucsim (git pulled from github.com/danieldrotos/ucsim, ucsim: 0.9.4)
		- exact commit used was e6acd12518f8c70313209b9946d9f571b0f9253b
	- m4 ((GNU M4) 1.4.17)
	- msp430-gcc ((GCC) 4.6.3 20120301 (mspgcc LTS 20120406 unpatched))
	- mspdebug(from github.com/romforth/mspdebug, until my changes
		are upstreamed)
	- wasmtime (wasmtime-cli 9.0.4)

After installing all the above dependencies, running `make` will build each of
the ports and run each of them in an emulator and should complete successfully.

To do a partial build, you can go into any individual processor specific
directory and run `make` within that subdirectory.
